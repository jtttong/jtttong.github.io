### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because this was my first time designing my own program for a high-low guessing game. I learned to declare and initialize a double variable that stores a number. Working in this lab also helped me understand how if statements work and how to convert a volume measurement from milliliters in the metric system to units in the US customary system.

* Lab 7

I like creating games, so Lab 7 was another favorite of mine, where I created a blackjack game. I created a more advanced high-low guessing game in this lab by adding more strings and providing a number as a command line argument. This lab taught me how to implement command line arguments as input and helped me understand how booleans worked.

* Lab 8

Lab 8, part 1 was my third favorite because it taught me how to create a pattern using nested loops. While coding, I learned more about outer and inner loop combinations. I also learned more about for loops and how to use them to get a certain number.
